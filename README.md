## Introduction
Ah food~ What's not to like about food? But we can't just eat right? We have to cook! How do we do that? We look at recipes! And,in fact, that is exactly what we will be doing in our project. In this project, we aim to unveil possible trends and/or patterns between each recipe's ratings and it's characteristics.

The raw data set that we were provided with consists of 2 DataFrames contained in `RAW_recipes.csv` and `RAW_interactions.csv` sourced from food.com. 

`RAW_recipes.csv` is a DataFrame with each row being a unqiue recipe and columns including the recipe's name, id, time needed, contributor, when it was submitted, tags, nutrition information, number of steps, steps, description, number of ingredients, and ingredients. `RAW_recipes.csv` has 83782 rows and 12 columns.

`RAW_interactions.csv`, on the contrary, is a DataFrame with each row representing an 'opinion' or an 'interaction' on a specific recipe. The DataFrame has columns reflecting the user's id, recipe's id, date of when this interaction was posted, rating (numerical 1-5) and review (literal description). `RAW_interactions.csv` has 731927 rows and 5 columns. Note that there might be multiple interactions on the same recipe.

## Data Cleaning and EDA

### Data Cleaning
To ensure that we will be able to access relevant information from the two DataFrames effectively, we have to do some data cleaning. 

The first step we did was left merging `RAW_recipes.csv` and `RAW_interactions.csv` on the recipe's id. 

We then replaced 0s in `ratings` with `np.nan` as when someone fails select a rating between 1 and 5, it defaults to 0, when it in fact should not be considered.

After replacing the ratings, we were able to add a new column that is the average rating of that specific recipe. Because we have multiple interactions per recipe, we averaged the ratings of those interactions and added it to a new column of the corresponding rows (recipes).

We then realized that columns `nutrition`, `tags`, `steps`, and `ingredients` are stored as strings when it should have been stored as lists for easier access. So for each of these columns, we used the `eval()` function to ensure that the values are lists. Additionally, we used the `nutrition` list we just created and made 7 more columns by extracting the values of each `nutrition` list, of which correspond to `"[calories (#), total fat (PDV), sugar (PDV), sodium (PDV), protein (PDV), saturated fat (PDV), and carbohydrates (PDV)]"` of each recipe. Therefore the `nutrition` column is now redundant so we will drop it. 

Finally, the last thing to clean is to make sure that the values in `submitted` and `date` are correctly stored as DateTime objects rather than strings, so we used `pd.to_datetime()` to complete the data cleaning process. The resulting DataFrame has 234428 rows and 24 columns

The first 5 rows of our cleaned DataFrame is showed below:

| name                                 |     id |   minutes |   contributor_id | submitted           | tags                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |   n_steps | steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ingredients                                                                                                                                                                    |   n_ingredients |   user_id |   recipe_id | date                |   rating | review                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   recipe_avg_rating |   calories |   total_fat |   sugar |   sodium |   protein |   sat_fat |   carbs |
